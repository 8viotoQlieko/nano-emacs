It then generates visual effects that match the rhythm, tempo, mood, and style of your music. You can also control some aspects of the visualizer, such as speed and sensitivity, using the on-screen menus or keyboard shortcuts.
 
Aeon is not only a plug-in, but also a standalone application that can visualize any sound input source supported by your computer, such as line-in audio, CD audio, or microphone input[^3^]. This means you can use Aeon to visualize live performances or streaming radio broadcasts. You can also save your visualizations as video files and share them with others.
 
Aeon is also compatible with the SoundSpectrum Window, a feature that allows you to watch Aeon while working in other applications. You can resize and position the SoundSpectrum Window anywhere on your screen and enjoy the music visualization without interruption. You can also use the V-Bar mode to display Aeon as a thin horizontal bar at the bottom of your screen.
