In December 2012, Embarcadero released Update 1 for RAD Studio XE3, which includes several enhancements and bug fixes for both Delphi and C++Builder users. The most notable new feature in this update is the new C++Builder 64-bit Windows compiler, which allows you to target the latest Windows platforms and take advantage of the increased memory and performance of 64-bit systems.
 
## C++Builder 64-bit Windows Compiler
 
The new C++Builder 64-bit Windows compiler is available in the Professional edition and higher of RAD Studio XE3. It supports the same language features and libraries as the existing 32-bit compiler, with some exceptions and limitations. You can use the same IDE and project files to build both 32-bit and 64-bit applications, and debug them with the integrated debugger. You can also use the FireMonkey framework to create cross-platform GUI applications for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android.
 
The C++Builder 64-bit compiler is based on the Clang open source compiler front-end, which provides better compatibility with modern C++ standards and third-party libraries. The compiler also supports some C++11 features, such as auto, decltype, nullptr, static\_assert, rvalue references, move semantics, lambdas, and variadic templates. You can find more details about the C++Builder 64-bit compiler in the online documentation.
 
## Other Fixes and Improvements
 
Update 1 for RAD Studio XE3 also includes fixes for various issues reported by users and identified by the product QA team. Some of the areas that have been improved are:
 
- FireMonkey framework: performance, stability, memory management, component behavior, styling, animations, etc.
- VCL framework: high DPI support, themes, styles, controls, etc.
- IDE: project management, code editor, code completion, refactoring, debugging, etc.
