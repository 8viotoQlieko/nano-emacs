- Practice in offline mode or free arenas. Before you jump into the main arena, where hundreds of players are competing for supremacy, you might want to practice your skills in offline mode or in one of the free arenas. You can fly against bots, try different vehicles and weapons, and learn the maps and objectives without risking your stats or reputation.
- Join a squad or team up with other players. Aces High III is a team-based game, where cooperation and communication are essential. You can join a squad or form a temporary team with other players in the game. You can use voice chat or text chat to coordinate your actions and tactics. You can also learn from more experienced players and get feedback on your performance.
- Choose your vehicle and loadout wisely. Aces High III offers a wide range of vehicles and loadouts to suit different play styles and situations. You can choose from fighters, bombers, transports, tanks, boats, and more. You can also customize your vehicle with different skins, weapons, and equipment. However, not every vehicle or loadout is suitable for every scenario. You need to consider factors such as speed, maneuverability, firepower, durability, range, altitude, and mission type when choosing your vehicle and loadout.
- Know your enemy and your environment. Aces High III simulates realistic physics and damage models for all vehicles and weapons. This means that you need to know the strengths and weaknesses of your own vehicle and your enemy's vehicle. You also need to know how to use the environment to your advantage. You can use clouds, sun glare, terrain features, landmarks, and other elements to hide, ambush, or escape from your enemies.

Aces High III is a game that rewards skill, strategy, and teamwork. It is also a game that offers endless fun and challenge for fans of WW1 and WW2 air combat. If you follow these tips, you will be able to enjoy the game more and improve your gameplay.
