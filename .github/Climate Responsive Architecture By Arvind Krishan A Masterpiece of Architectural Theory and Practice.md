Climate Responsive Architecture is a design handbook for energy efficient buildings by Arvind Krishan, a professor of architecture at the School of Planning and Architecture, New Delhi. The book, published in 2001, provides a comprehensive overview of the principles and practices of climate responsive architecture, with case studies from India and other tropical and subtropical regions. The book aims to help architects, engineers, planners, and students understand the climatic factors that affect building design and performance, and to apply appropriate strategies for achieving thermal comfort, energy conservation, and environmental quality.
 
The book is divided into four parts: Part I introduces the concept and scope of climate responsive architecture, and explains the basic elements of climate and its classification. Part II discusses the methods and tools for climatic analysis and design, such as bioclimatic charts, sun path diagrams, wind roses, psychrometric charts, and software applications. Part III presents the design guidelines and criteria for various climatic zones, such as hot-dry, warm-humid, composite, temperate, and cold. Part IV showcases some examples of climate responsive buildings in India and abroad, highlighting their architectural features, passive design strategies, active systems, and performance evaluation.

Climate responsive architecture is not only a technical approach, but also a creative and holistic one that considers the social, cultural, and economic aspects of the context. The book by Arvind Krishan emphasizes the importance of involving the users and the community in the design process, and of creating buildings that are adaptable, flexible, and responsive to changing needs and preferences. The book also highlights the benefits of climate responsive architecture for achieving sustainability goals, such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions, enhancing biodiversity, improving human health and well-being, and saving costs and resources.
 
The book by Arvind Krishan is one of the pioneering works on climate responsive architecture in India, where the climatic diversity and the rapid urbanization pose significant challenges and opportunities for building design. The book draws from the rich heritage of vernacular architecture in India, which has evolved over centuries to suit the local climate and culture. The book also showcases some of the contemporary examples of climate responsive architecture in India, such as the Centre for Environmental Planning and Technology (CEPT) in Ahmedabad, the Indian Institute of Management (IIM) in Bangalore, and the Energy Research Institute (TERI) in New Delhi.
 
Climate Responsive Architecture is a timely and relevant book that offers practical guidance and inspiration for architects, engineers, planners, students, and anyone interested in creating buildings that are harmonious with nature and human needs. The book is a testament to Arvind Krishan's vision and expertise in the field of climate responsive architecture, and his contribution to advancing the knowledge and practice of sustainable design in India and beyond.
